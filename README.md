This project contains two main python files.
The only difference is that one uses 2 buttons and a joystick through the GPIO ports on a raspberry pi, appropriately named with the addition of GPIO to the end of its name.
The other will run on any computer with pygame, python, and a keyboard. 
If you wish to use the GPIO version. 
You can set it up like mine using a breadboard (shown in images below) or you can set it up in a way that works with your raspberry pi. Just make sure you change the GPIO input location in the code.
The rest of the files are used for the sprites and the visual aspects of the game, all made by me.
